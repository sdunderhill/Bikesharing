# CitiBike Bikesharing

## Can bikesharing work in Des Moines, IA

### Overview

Me and my friend Kate had a great time on our trip to NYC highlighted by the CitiBike bikesharing business there. We decided we would like to bring a bike share business to Des Moines, IA where we live. Kate found someone who might be willing to back us in our adventure. We collected the data from NYC to get an idea of how it works there. This is needed so we can adjust to the needs of Des Moines. Below are the key points that we feel are the most important data points. We collected data from August because of the weather and the potential for this being peak season for people to be out and about.

### Data

To truly get a sense of how the bike share works in NYC we decided to hit on a few main points.
* How long is the most frequent ride?
* Where is the most frequent start location?
* Where is the most frequent end location?
* Who is most likely to rent a bike? Men or Women?
* What day and time has the highest frequency of bike trips?
* Does who and where match when compiled together?
* Who and what time of day is the most common?

1. To start we looked at the length of time. From the August NYC data, we can tell the average length of ride is 5 minutes. We can presume that data is showing us that people are going short distances between sites. We would need to gather information on what is near the exact locations where they start and stop.

2. Next is the most frequent start locations. We have generated a cirle map to show where the frequency occurs. The darkest red shows the most frequent and the lightest blue shows the least frequent.

3. Now we looked at the end locations. This map isnt much different than the start time map. When zooming in you can tell there are slight differences. The coorelates with the length of rent time. Not much distance is covered in 5 minutes.

4. Next we looked at who is most like to rent a bike. Would it be men or women? From this graph we can see that men are most likely to rent a bike. The trip duration stayed the same at 5 minutes.

5. From the heatmap below we can tell that between 5 pm and 7 pm on Thursday evenings is the most popular time.

6. The next two heatmaps show that when the who is riding and where are they starting are compiled together it's consistent with the findings from earlier. Men are most likely to rent bikes between the hours of 5pm and 7pm on Thursdays.

### Summary

After looking at the data for NYC we can determine the days of the week and what times that bike sharing is most frequently used. We can also tell who is most likely to rent them and where. To determine how bike sharing will work for Des Moines we need to compile more data. We need to know what is in the surrounding area where bikes are most frequently being rented in NYC. It would also be helpful to know what the gender makeup is of the population in the Manhattan area. Is there a coorelation between that data and the fact that men are most likely to rent a bike? Then we need to collect data from Des Moines of their metorpolitan and downtown areas to determine where their ride share would be most successful. We will need to collect: 

* What types of businesses are in the downtown area?
* What is the makeup of the population of that area in reference to gender? This will give us an idea of who is most likely to use the bike share.
* When is the weather the best for being outdoors? This will give us an idea of when our most profitable time will be.
